I used to keep logs of my daily productivity with .txt files but it got tedious after a while so I made an app that creates a txt if the txt for the day have not been created yet.

Version 0.0.1:
   the code is a mess right now but I'll tidy it up.
   for this version you have to manually set up the log folder for the code to work.
